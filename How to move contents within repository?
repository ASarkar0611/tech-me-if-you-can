## GitHub commands to be used to move contents between repositories. ChatGPT helped me with these steps and worked smoothly.

## Prerequisites:

Need to be installed - VS Code, Git

1. Clone Parent Repo -> git clone https://github.com/username/parentrepo.git
2. cd parentrepo
3. Add chile repo remotely -> git remote add remoteaddname https://github.com/username/childrepo.git
4. git fetch remoteaddname
5. Add child repo as a directory to parent repo -> git subtree add --prefix=childrepo ml main --squash
6. git push origin main
7. To reuse the remoteaddname - git remote remove remoteaddname
